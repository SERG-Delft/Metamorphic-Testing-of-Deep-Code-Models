# Metamorphic Testing of Deep Code Models: A Systematic Literature Review

This repository contains data related to the paper **"Metamorphic Testing of Deep Code Models: A Systematic Literature Review"** authored by **Ali Asgari, Milan de Koning, Pouria Derakhshanfar, and Annibale Panichella**.

## Overview

This study presents a **systematic literature review (SLR)** on metamorphic testing for deep code models, analyzing **45 papers published between 2019 and 2024**. We provide a comprehensive list of **metamorphic transformations** and summarize the **strategies used for robustness testing in deep code models**. Additionally, we investigate and rank the most frequently evaluated **code-related tasks, models, downstream languages, and datasets**.

### Main Elements of Our Analysis

The following key aspects were extracted and analyzed from the reviewed papers:
- **TransformationType**: Categorization of metamorphic transformations applied in robustness testing.
- **Strategy**: The approach used to generate and evaluate adversarial or metamorphic test cases.
- **Models**: Deep learning and large language models evaluated in the studies.
- **Dataset**: The benchmark datasets used to train and test the models.
- **Task**: The specific software engineering or program analysis tasks targeted in each study.
- **Languages**: The programming languages involved in the evaluated tasks.

## Data and Supplementary Materials

- **`All_Papers_Final.json`**: This file contains the **final list of papers** included in the systematic literature review, capturing all relevant information extracted from each study.
- **`supplementary-V1.pdf`**: This file contains the **initial dataset**, encompassing all records, including some that were marked as doubtful. Some records have undergone modifications following discussions and double-checking by the authors for the final paper. Therefore, **minor differences may exist** between this dataset and the final tables presented in the published paper.
- **`PreFinal` folder**: This folder contains **two `.bib` files (`Scholar.bib` and `primarystudies.bib`)** with details about the **pre-final papers** considered in our literature review. Some of the papers listed in these files were later removed from the final version after further refinement and selection. However, these files provide **insights into the intermediate stages of our data collection process**, capturing the middle journey of our work.
