# Metamorphic Testing of Deep Code Models: A Systematic Literature Review

This repository contains data related to the paper **"Metamorphic Testing of Deep Code Models: A Systematic Literature Review"** authored by Ali Asgari, Milan de Koning, Pouria Derakhshanfar, and Annibale Panichella.

## Overview

This study presents a **systematic literature review (SLR)** on metamorphic testing for deep code models, analyzing **45 papers published between 2019 and 2024**. We provide a comprehensive list of metamorphic transformations and summarize the strategies used for robustness testing in deep code models. Additionally, we investigate and rank the most frequently evaluated **code-related tasks, models, downstream languages, and datasets**.

## Data and Supplementary Materials

- **`supplementary-V1.pdf`**: This file contains the **initial dataset**, encompassing all records, including some that were marked as doubtful. Some records have undergone modifications following discussions and double-checking by the authors for the final paper. Therefore, **minor differences may exist** between this dataset and the final tables presented in the published paper.

- **`PreFinal` folder**: This folder contains **two `.bib` files (`Scholar.bib` and `primarystudies.bib`)** with details about the **pre-final papers** considered in our literature review. Some of the papers listed in these files were later removed from the final version after further refinement and selection. However, these files provide **insights into the intermediate stages of our data collection process**, capturing the middle journey of our work.
